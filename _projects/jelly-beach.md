### What is [Jelly Beach](https://www.echoes-vip.org/themes/interactive-chapbooks/jelly-beach){:target="_blank"}? ###
**Jelly Beach** is a short trading game based of one of [John Roche's](https://www.poetryplayhouse.com/shop-art-books/johns-books){:target="_blank"} poem, *Ode to a Jelly Donut*, where you wander through boardwalk, exploring childlike joy, and aim to obtain a jelly donut! 

**Jelly Beach** is part of an ongoing student-led vertically integrated project, [*echoes*](https://www.echoes-vip.org/){:target="_blank"}, at RIT. *echoes* aims to create community inspired games that reflect the deep meaningful impacts these members have had on us, while allowing students to collaborate in cross-functional agile teams and foster stronger industry and professional skills.

#### Concept Art
Below is some of the concept art I drew when brainstorming Jelly Beach's NPCs. I wanted to make sure the NPCs resembled the fashion of the 1960s, fit the theme of Jelly Beach, and conveyed their roles in the narrative through the limited pixels.
