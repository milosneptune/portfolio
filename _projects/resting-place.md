### What is [A Resting Place](https://mirisy.itch.io/a-resting-place){:target="_blank"}?
**A Resting Place** is a short, atmospheric point-and-click game set in abstract, liminal spaces. You follow a silent guide, interacting with the environment as traces and signs surface, leaving meaning open to interpretation.

The game is entirely wordless. Progress is made by observing your surroundings and interacting with a small number of objects in each space, guided by visual and audio cues.

A Resting Place was created by a team of five people over the course of two weeks, participating in a [game jam](https://itch.io/jam/thatgamejam01){:target="_blank"} hosted by [thatgamecompany](https://thatgamecompany.com/){:target="_blank"}.

  * Playtest Unity builds often, providing feedback around pacing and confusion points
  * Supported team with both technical and artistic knowledge, minimizing confusion beween the two disciplines and enabling for a stronger, faster workflow

#### Design
One of my favorite parts of this game was the slow transition from pixel art to non-pixel. I helped create the pixel art for two of the stages
