### What is [Terra](){:target="_blank"}? ###
**Terra** is a print & play cooperative environmental strategy game in which two parties of players seek to restore a demolished urbanscape in their respective images: one seeks to urbanize and repopulate the environment as much as possible, while the other wishes for nature to take the ruin’s place.

Terra was an academic project made for the course, IGME-220, Game Design & Development I. Our team was made up of five people. Below is a sell sheet I designed.
